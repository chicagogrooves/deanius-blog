Hello imagined reader.

Since you are a projection of my own imagination, I see your best qualities so clearly ! And you have clearly noticed an absence of writings from this blog. I have so much to write about, and so much I'm learning, yet a paucity of posts recently. How did this situation come about, you ask ?

Well, I found that writing on a blog != participating in a community. 

As you can tell by my [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/326532/dean-radcliffe) profile, I've been posting answers here and there. My reputation recently went north of 500, putting me in the top 5% of users on the Stack. Admittedly I have a long way to go before my reputation reflects where I feel my professional competency is at, but writing blog posts won't help that.

Also, I've submitted a few (minor) patches to projects on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) that I care about. Notably, I made the contributors list of [Reactive CoffeeScript](https://github.com/yang/reactive-coffee), thanks Yang Zhang for that very cool library. I hope to contribute to [RequireJS](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs) soon as that too has been revolutionizing how I think about front-end work, thanks too, JR Burke.

So in a nutshell, while I hope to synthesize my recent months of learning in an ImpressJS presentation that I take to local user group (and post on this blog of course), in the meantime, I'm content to have my learning manifest in accepted pull requests and SO answers.

So dear Reader, in the meanwhile, catch up with me in the world of actually getting stuff done - you can find me there an awful lot of the time ! Cheers ! 

PS One thing that I do hope to post on this blog, since it's more rant-oriented, is about the regressions I feel iOS7 made compared to iOS6, in both esthetics and actual usability. But I'll need to gather some sources to really bolster that since I can tell it's likely to be skeptically received. Bring it on I say ! :)
