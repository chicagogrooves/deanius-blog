It'll be good to return to teaching. I've left development for teaching before. It was developer training, but it was teaching nonetheless. This time around however I'm a lot more excited and a lot more nervous.

That time, in the early 2000's, it was Microsoft .Net and Office products I focused on, and only a little web stuff. This time it'll be Open Source and community driven products like Rails and Node, and as much front-end HTML and JavaScript I can manage. That time, I felt pretty alone at the school - no teachers had the career experience in software that I did, and I hardly even met other teachers. This time, I know several of the people I'll be teaching with from the field already, and I even consider some of them mentor-level figures. There will be a more communal aspect of the school where teachers and students mingle more freely - that's part of the value proposition for the students, and will help me out quite a bit too.

Education has undergone a phase transition since 10 years ago. I felt it coming - people were turning more to online resources, and attendance had started dropping at the training centers I worked at. But we've now come out the other side and learned that online resources have their place, and yet the value of the in-person instructor has been restored. Schools like DevBootCamp, Startup Institute, Starter League and the Experience Institute are heralding the rebirth of an educational style focused on learning-by-doing. They don't promise you certifications, they promise transformations in what you are capable of. Having met and known several students of these schools, you bet that they are going to unleash transformations on their worlds in kind, so it's an exciting thing to be witnessing.

Jess, my fiancee, is a 6th grade Math teacher, and very up on the latest standards. She speaks of the "flipped classroom" where conceptual learning - what used to be 'lecture' - is now conveyed through reading and video watching assignments to be done at home. Then students come in and do exercises together, with the teacher present. Homework in class, lecture at home - flipped classroom ! 

I have historically gone to great lengths to come up with interesting metaphors, diagrams and stories that reveal the concepts being learned, and tried to 'perform' them for my classes. There is great tradition here - the SICP lectures and Richard Feynmann lectures on QED are great influences to me. I learned them so well I could probably perform sub-parts of either lecture years after my last viewing of them. Will this go away in the modern classroom ? I hope not. But I will be assessing how and when to use this style of instruction. 

On the one hand I am relieved however. The schools I'm partnering with this time around have more and better curriculum prepared. So the 'at-home' part of the instruction- even the goals for the in-class exercises and labs - are defined for me, which will let me focus on the just-in-time individual help I'll be able to give. But I have a feeling I will still come up with fun lectures periodically because I do enjoy that quite a bit :)

PS It will be interesting to compare notes with Jess as she elaborates upon her own flipped classroom concepts and multi-modal learning concepts for the youth. Perhaps I will even get some vicarious education just living with her while she undertakes her next degree in education this winter.
