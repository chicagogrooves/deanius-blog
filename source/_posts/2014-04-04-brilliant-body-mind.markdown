At Orange Fitness the other night, the guy on the treadmill next to me and I had a good rapport. At the end of the workout I introduced Jess to him, and he remarked that I was a "brilliant runner." 

On the one hand, that comment is probably attributable to his being English, where the word "brilliant" is a more commonly used superlative than here. On the other hand, it's a brilliant juxtaposition to use the word "brilliant" to describe running, an intensely physical activity. Or is it ? 

Although we talk about "muscle memory", the kind of coordination of movements required for sports, music, typing, etc. are stored in the brain, not the muscles. My swim coach Fred Evans knew that 'practicing' for a swim meet by playing the event on a movie screen inside your mind can improve your performance! This is because you are shaping the programs inside your head, without the use of your muscles at all. Studies show similar benefits for musicians who practice scales in their minds, visualizing every detail of movement. Brilliant practice indeed.

It has been transformative to learn that by working my body, by looking for measurable improvements in physical performance, that I am actually observing the evolution of my mental abilities. The fact that I can run 2:30 per mile faster than when I first started running surely is helped by strengthening of ligaments, but it's mostly that I have honed, and stored efficient patterns of movement. These had to evolve in stride with physical improvements too - there are no shortcuts - but the net result is stored in the mind as well as the body. The difference in stride between me and an 11:30/mile first year runner is as notable to me as the difference between myself and a 2:40 marathoner. It's not mainly body fat percentage, it's stored patterns of movement that work for my body. 

I started running when I was 30. I had little to no sports involvement when young. I had two seasons of mediocre high school swimming. I was a math-lete, not an athlete. I was lousy at the 600-yard dash in middle school, usually slowing to a walk, I could do 0 pullups, and could not climb the rope. So I'm quick to believe that somebody, anybody, can settle the nature-vs-nurture debate for themselves by learning new patterns of movement. The only way to do this ? Practice, practice, enduring sweat and pain, but trusting that at the end of the day, it's truly all in your head.
